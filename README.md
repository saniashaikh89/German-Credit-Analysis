# German-Credit-Analysis
Context
When a bank receives a loan application, based on the applicant’s profile the bank has to decide whether to go ahead with the loan approval or not. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision –

If the applicant is a good credit risk, i.e. is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan to the person results in a loss of business to the bank
If the applicant is a bad credit risk, i.e. is not likely to repay the loan, then approving the loan to the person results in a financial loss to the bank
To minimize this loss HRE bank wants to automate this process using a predictive model, that will predict if a customer is at risk of making a default or not based on the customer’s demographic and socio-economic profiles

You as a Data scientist at HRE bank has been assigned the work of building a predictive model that will predict if a customer is at risk of default or not

Objective
The objective is to build a model to predict whether a person would default or not. In this dataset, the target variable is 'Risk'.
